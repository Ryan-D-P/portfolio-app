                <p>I possess many fundamental web development skills, including: HTML5, CSS, Sass, responsive web design, Javascript (ES6/ES7), ReactJS, Git+Github, and source code debugging.</p>
                <p>I've become familiar with CSS responsive layouts and styling (especially with flexbox layouts), while I'm currently learning many new things with React: with which I am becoming far more comfortable, and learning to use its many powerful features to develop web applications.</p>
